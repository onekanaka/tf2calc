# TF2 Calc v1.0
Team Fortress 2 Metal/Key calculator

This project was created with Eclipse Luna SR2, [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Requirements:
- Install the latest JDK available, [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- Install Maven, [https://maven.apache.org/](https://maven.apache.org/)
- Add the project inside `Source Code` to a new workspace in Eclipse
- Run the project as `maven install` to generate the `.jar` necessary for running the application anywhere, if you have the JVM installed (included in any JRE or JDK)
- If you want to learn how to generate a `.exe` file for Java applications, an option is **Launch4j** (last version tested was 3.8), [http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/)
  - Copy `tf2_calc_logo_48x48.ico` and `tf2calc_launch4j.xml` to your Desktop (or any place easily accessible), open Launch4j, and load `tf2calc_launch4j.xml`
  - Check the settings loaded, change the path for `tf2_calc_logo_48x48.ico` and where the new `.exe` will be saved, and click "Build Wrapper"
